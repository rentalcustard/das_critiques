This repository contains code sketches and essays written in response to Gary 
Bernhardt's [Destroy All Software](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com) 
screencasts, which are excellent. They are sometimes for my benefit and 
sometimes to point out what I perceive as flaws in the hope of sparking 
discussion and mutual learning. I hope they are viewed in a charitable light 
and as attempts at further enlightenment rather than trying to pick a fight. :)
